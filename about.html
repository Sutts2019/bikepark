    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p>If you're reading this then you have most likely already seen the basic map I've created showing the locations of mountain bike parks and trail centres across the UK.</p>
    <p>When I was recently made redundant, I decided the first thing I was going to do was buy a new mountain bike and return to the hobby I used to enjoy so much. I very quickly fell in love again with riding at my local bike park, and although I have a lot of fun there, I soon wanted to find other places to go and ride. Although there are some big name bikeparks now, there are also a load of smaller parks and trail centres that don't get as much press and I thought it would be great if I could find a map that showed all the bike parks and trail centres in one place. Unfortunately, although there are sites that list a lot of these places, I couldn't find anywhere that had the map I was looking for - so I made one! </p>
    <p>After spending a few hours scouring the internet and putting all the markers on google maps, I finally had the resource I had been looking for and it occurred to me that others may find this useful as well - so I have published it here for all to use.</p>
    <p>I have marked the locations of all the bikeparks and trail centres that I could find, and provided a link to their respective websites or facebook page. Note the map does not include any individual trails or locations that appear to have no facilities.</p>
    <p>DISCLAIMER - please note I have no links or affiliation to any of these places and have not visited most of them (yet!) so please check in advance that they are open before you head out. </p>
    <p>If you do find that any of the points on the map are incorrect, have closed or otherwise need amending please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> so I can update the map.</p>

    <p>Hopefully the map is useful to you - if it is, please consider <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/bewilderness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buying me a coffee</a>, this will help with hosting and allow me to keep this map up.</p>
