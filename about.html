    <p>Hi! If you're reading this then you have most likely already seen the (very!) basic map I created. When I was recently made redundant, I decided the first thing I was going to do was buy a new mountain bike and return to a hobby I used to love so much. I soon fell in love with riding at my local bike park, and although I have a lot of fun there, I soon wanted to find other places to go and ride. Although there are some big name bikeparks now (looking at you BPW and Dyfi!), there are also a load of smaller parks and trail centres that don't get as much press and I thought it would be great if I could find a map that showed all the bike parks and trail centres in one place so that I could consider where to go. Unfortunately, although there are sites that list a lot of these places, I couldn't find anywhere that had the map I was looking for - so I made one! </p>
    <p>After spending a few hours scouring the internet and putting all the markers on google maps, I finally had the resource I had been looking for. It then occurred to me that maybe others might find this useful as well, so i have published this for all to do with as they see fit.</p>
    <p>I have marked the locations of all the bikeparks and trail centres that I could find, and provided a link to the respective website or facebook page. Note the map does not include individual trails or locations that appear to have no facilities.</p>
    <p>Also, please note I have no links or affiliation to any of these places and have not visited most of them (yet!) so please check in advance that they are open before you head out. If you do find that any of the points on the map are incorrect, have closed or otherwise need amending please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> so I can update the map.</p>

    <p>Hopefully the map is useful to you - if it is, please consider <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/bewilderness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buying me a coffee</a>, this will with hosting and allow me to keep this map up.</p>
